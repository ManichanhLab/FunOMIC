# FunOMIC
FunOMIC is a pipeline with built-in taxonomic and functional fungal databases for the identification of fungal species and their functions in shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. With FunOMIC-T, the built-in taxonomic database that includes more than 1,6 million fungal single-copy marker genes, we show that FunOMIC accurately assigns fungal taxonomies at species level. FunOMIC-P, the built-in functional database that includes more than 3 million of fungal protein sequences,  was able to provide an automated and reliable way to characterise fungal functions in shotgun sequencing datasets from environmental samples.
